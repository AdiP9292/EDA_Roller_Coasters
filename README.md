# Exploratory Data Analysis on Roller Coasters Dataset

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project performed on a roller coasters dataset sourced from Kaggle. The project aims to uncover trends, insights, and interesting patterns in global roller coaster data using Python and popular data analysis libraries.
****
**Dataset Description:**
The dataset provides comprehensive information about roller coasters around the world, including attributes such as:
- Name, Park, and Location

- Type (wooden or steel)

- Status (operating, closed, removed)

- Physical characteristics: height, speed, length, inversions

- Manufacturer and design elements

- Year of opening

  
****

**Project Goals**
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

- Handle missing values and identify inconsistencies.

- Visualize trends and distributions in coaster characteristics.

- Explore relationships between features such as height, speed, and inversions.

- Identify top manufacturers, countries with the most coasters, and changes over time.
